/**
 * Caches the result of buildFullGraph between calls so that:
 *  - multiple embedded code blocks on the same page reuse one scan
 *  - the side-panel view doesn't rescan the vault on every depth/mode toggle
 *  - buildLocalGraph (which calls buildFullGraph internally) becomes cheap to call repeatedly
 *
 * The cache is invalidated on:
 *  - any vault file change picked up by metadataCache (frontmatter edits, file
 *    creation/deletion/rename) — the plugin's main.ts wires `invalidate()` to
 *    the same event handlers it uses to refresh views
 *  - any settings change that affects graph construction — detected via a hash
 *    of the structurally relevant subset of settings (types, scopes, tags, image
 *    property). Cosmetic-only settings like showLegend or layout don't bust it.
 *
 * Holding a cached graph is safe because:
 *  - it's plain data (no DOM refs), so it doesn't leak Cytoscape instances
 *  - it's a single ~few-hundred-KB object even for vaults with thousands of
 *    notes, comparable to a single open document
